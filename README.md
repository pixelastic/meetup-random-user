# meetup-random-user

This website lets you pick a random attendee in any meetup. Useful for
organizers that wants to give goodies to a random attendee.

Paste the url of the event in the field and submit the form. One of the random
users will be displayed.

## How it works

When you submit the form, a request is made to a custom server-side script
(hosted on webtask.io). This script will receive the meetup.com url, download
it, parse its HTML, and return a JSON object of a random attendee.

The initial webpage will then display the results.

## What is Webtask.io?

[Webtask.io][2] is an awesome service provided by the awesome people at
[Auth0][3]. It lets you upload server-side JavaScript snippets to their hosted
platform. You can then request those snippets through a custom url, and have
your code executed server-side.

I'm using it here to do the download + parsing of the meetup.com page, as
I cannot do it in the browser directly, because of CORS issues.

The script is available in `./webtask/meetup-random-user.js`, and accessible at
`https://wt-a2f9d5672798ac7ef42b871652a58fb0-0.run.webtask.io/meetup-random-user`.
You won't have the rights to edit, but feel free to push your own copy of it to
your own account if you'd like to add any changes to it.

## How to test it locally?

You can test the output of the webtask function by running `yarn run test`. It
will in turn run the `test.js` file. A meetup url is hardcoded inside this file,
you have to check if the output seems ok.
